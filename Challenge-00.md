# Challenge 00 - Prerequisites - Ready, Set, GO!

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-01.md)

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the OpenAI & Semantic Kernel Fundamentals What The Hack. Before you can hack, you will need to set up some prerequisites.

## Description
In this challenge, you will set up the necessary prerequisites and environment to complete the rest of the hack, including:
- [Access Azure OpenAI](#access-azure-openai)
- [GitHub CodeSpaces](#setup-github-codespace) or [Local Workstation](#setup-local-workstation)



### Access Azure OpenAI 

You will need an Azure subscription to complete this hack. If you don't have one, get a free trial here...
- [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

- [Azure Passes](#setup-azure-pass): If your hack-a-thon group has access to an Azure Pass, you can utilize it to gain access to Azure OpenAI and other necessary Azure resources for this Hack-a-thon.


### Setup Azure Pass
TBD

### Setup GitHub CodeSpace
You can use [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) where we have a pre-configured Visual Studio Code lab environment set up and ready to go for you, or you can setup a Development environment on your local workstation.

A GitHub Codespace is a development environment that is hosted in the cloud that you access via a browser. All of the pre-requisite developer tools for this hack are pre-installed and available in the codespace.

- [Use GitHub Codespaces](#use-github-codespaces)
- [Use Local Workstation](#use-local-workstation)

We highly recommend using GitHub Codespaces to make it easier complete this hack.

#### Use GitHub Codespaces

You must have a GitHub account to use GitHub Codespaces. If you do not have a GitHub account, you can [Sign Up Here](https://github.com/signup).

GitHub Codespaces is available for developers in every organization. All personal GitHub.com accounts include a monthly quota of free usage each month. GitHub will provide users in the Free plan 120 core hours, or 60 hours of run time on a 2 core codespace, plus 15 GB of storage each month.

You can see your balance of available codespace hours on the [GitHub billing page](https://github.com/settings/billing/summary).

The GitHub Codespace for this hack will host Visual Studio Code with .NET 8 and relevant extensions installed, the starter application, configuration files, and other data files needed for this event. Here are the steps you will need to follow:

- A GitHub repo containing the student resources and Codespace for this hack is hosted here:
  - [WTH OpenAI and Semantic Kernel Fundamentals Repo](https://github.com/RandyPatterson/AOAI_Student)
  - Please open this link and sign in with your personal Github account. 

**NOTE:** Make sure you do not sign in with your enterprise managed Github account.

- Once you are signed in, click on the green "Code" button. Then click on "Codespaces". Finally, hit "Create codespace on main".

Your Codespace environment should load in a new browser tab. It will take approximately 3-5 minutes the first time you create the codespace for it to load.

- When the codespace completes loading, you should find an instance of Visual Studio Code running in your browser with the files needed for this hackathon.

You are ready to run the Jupyter Notebook files, hooray! Skip to section: [Setup Azure OpenAI](#setup-azure-openai)

#### Use Local Workstation

**NOTE:** You can skip this section if are using GitHub Codespaces!

If you want to setup a Jupyter Notebooks environment on your local workstation, expand the section below and follow the requirements listed.

To work on your local workstation, please ensure you have the following tools and resources before hacking:

- [Student Resources](#student-resources)
- [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code)
  - [C# Dev Kit Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
- [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Azure CLI (Optional)](https://aka.ms/installazurecli)

##### Student Resources

[Git Repo Student Resources](https://github.com/RandyPatterson/AOAI_Student)

The rest of the challenges will refer to the relative paths inside the Git Repository where you can find the various resources to complete the challenges.



## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

If using GitHub Codespaces:

- Verify you have the following files & folders available in the Codespace:
  TBD


If working on a local workstation: 

- Verify that you have Visual Studio Code with the C# Dev Kit Extension installed or Visual Studio 2022
- Verify you have the following files & folders locally:
    - TBD
